Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive robotic control and monitoring system.
Our primary objectives were to establish reliable TCP/IP communications for commanding and 
data acquisition, use shared memory with semaphores for inter-process communication, accurately 
calculate the robots position and orientation using laserscan and odometry data, and implement 
a linear control program to navigate the robot on a predefined path.
